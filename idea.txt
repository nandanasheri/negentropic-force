Idea for Project 2 :

cosmological imagery, space, galaxy, nature of light, halos, stars - things that are very cosmic themed
Belson doesn’t give interviews, write about his work, or discuss his methods, leaving the viewer to derive his/her own experiences and meanings from his films - everything is left to the viewer 

“The films are not meant to be explained, analyzed, or understood. They are more experiential, more like listening to music.” - so we cannot technically see what his own commentary on everything that he does within allures.

He was doing these vortex concerts - electronic music concerts illuminated by visuals - somewhat transcending 

he withdrew his films - shrouded in secrecy 

the effects of psychedelics?? - Belson held fast to the idea that the flaming, spinning mandalas and spacescapes in his works were representations of an inner consciousness. inner consciousness could mean 

definitely code a flaming mandalas - maybe they increase in size and move?? - transcending effect

But of course, I prefer this quote from Belson which he used for his entire filmography: “It’s a glorious thing if you don’t expect an explanation.” - he clearly doesn't intend for too many real commentaries???

basically a psychedelic experience - spirographs - plasma orb - atomic structure with nucleus at the center - organic molecular forms 

a journey through your inner consciousness - how our time here is limited, how nothing is truly permanent - we're all just floating - we are nothing but a bunch of atoms meshed together - our insignificance on this planet OR it could be the effect of psychedelics - but again i wouldn't know..

try to start with all these cosmic elements and they get bigger and bigger and bigger - mandalas, spirographs, orbs - things that are rotating - constant quick movement - flashing colors

then it sort of becomes nothing - like it keeps expanding and flashes into nothing 

purely relative - nothing else for positioning
