# Negentropic Force

## Project from ART 151, Spring 2024

This sketch is an ode to Jordan Belson's Allures and is a generative composition using p5.js. The whole animation induces a trance and psychedelic effect in the viewer's eyes. Starting off with very bright colors, and fast paced animation, it draws its audience to think about their place in the world and how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things.
